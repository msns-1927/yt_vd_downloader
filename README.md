# yt_vd_downloader
A simple Tkinter-based YouTube downloader built with Python and yt-dlp. Supports multiple resolutions and audio formats with a user-friendly interface.

With the increasing consumption of online video content, users often require offline access to videos. YouTube does not provide an official method for direct downloads. This project offers a practical solution using open-source Python tools.

Objectives:
•	Download YouTube videos in selected resolutions
•	Provide audio-only download option
•	Allow folder selection for saving files
Scope:
•	User-friendly GUI interface
•	Python-based lightweight tool
•	Downloads individual videos (playlist support can be added)
